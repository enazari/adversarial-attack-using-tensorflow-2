# Adversarial Attacks
In the repo there are a number of adversarial attack methods.
Implemented Methods: 
* __Fast Gradient Sign Method(FSGM)__,  
* __One-step Target Class Method__,
* __Basic Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method__.

These algorithms have been implemented with __Python__ via __Tensorflow-2__ in jupyter notebooks.
